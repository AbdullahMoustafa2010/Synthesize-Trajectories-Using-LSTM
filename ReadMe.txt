Arrangment of code execution:

To run the code you have to follow the steps as following:

Step 1: In this step we format the data for training to be as a time series (t1 .. t4) and the next value of (t5).

Step 2: In this step, we use the data obtained from the previous step, normalize it, and train a LSTM network, then trying to predict some values using our test data. Also our obtained model is saved. and a visual based assesment for the prediction accuracy is manipulated.

Step 3: In this step, we Synthesize some trajectories using many models of the scene.


NOTE: This version of code is not optimized.
